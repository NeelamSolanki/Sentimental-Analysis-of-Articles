# Sentiment Analysis of Articles

This project explores the application of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to perform sentiment analysis on a collection of articles.

**Key Features:**

* **Text Preprocessing:** Implements text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction techniques for effective text analysis.
* **Sentiment Classification:** Utilizes a variety of machine learning models, including **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **Naive Bayes**, and **deep learning models** such as **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **Transformers**, to accurately classify the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in the articles.
* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* **[Optional: Add any specific features of your project here, e.g., "Real-time sentiment analysis", "Visualization of results", "Integration with a specific API"]**

**Technologies Used:**

* **Python** 
* **NLP libraries:** NLTK, spaCy, Transformers
* **Machine Learning libraries:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch

**This project aims to demonstrate the power of NLP and machine learning in understanding and interpreting human emotions expressed in written text.**
